# Simple Contract
An app that simplifies and breaks down the legal documents, we provide complete analysis of the document and also provide a feature to translate to multiple Indian languages.

#### Problem
In India, millions of people living in rural areas,farmers and people living in slum areas are cheated, and their land is grabbed.
#### How does this happen ?
These people are tricked into signing complex legal documents, which are shown as if they would benefit them but they are cheated.
Eg : Farmers entering into contract farming with complex terms, end up with the corporate or private buyer cheating them and grabbing their lands.

Generally legal documents and agreements are difficult to understand and often people face difficulties in moving forward with it.

#### So what does our solution do.
We simplify and break down the legal document, we provide complete analysis of the document and also provide a feature to translate to multiple Indian languages.

Along with the farmers,people living in rural and slum areas, our solution can help any induvidual or group who is trying to wrap their head around a complex legal contract or document.
